<p style="color: #ffffff"> This is a symbolic story about the trials and tribulations of having to sell a product with copyright protected material. Copyright law has been continuously abused by the largest corporations in our country. Creativity and innovation is being bottlenecked by unjust and predatory copyright laws. Bear in mind that the following audio story is meant to be mostly comedic. I like to make comments about certain things like Chinese copyright law, Disney, Twitter, and Instagram, because all of these things have a huge effect on how we handle copyright law in this country. </p>

<p style="color: #ffffff"> Twitter and Instagram have a huge effect on what products gain traction, and who receives cease and desist letters from major corporations telling them to stop selling products with items that violate copyright. Think about the products you see on your Instagram feed on a daily basis. People are ripping off logos, characters, and all different types of copyrighted works. Remember that badass T-shirt with spongebob smoking a blunt? Sell enough of that shirt youâ€™ll have nickelodeon on you asking for your money, unless you can prove fair use. Fair use is one of the only doctrines allowing people to use copyrighted material for criticism, teaching, or research without the permission of the body that owns the copyrighted material. Even if you did claim that your cool spongebob tee was being critical of Spongebob as a concept, you would have to get a lawyer and argue that in court, not something your average person getting into the creative market is willing to do. In the end, if you have the money for a good lawyer you might be able to sell your cool Spongebob tee, but for all the normal people out there the current landscape makes it very difficult to make products that use copyright items, even if the project falls under fair use. </p>

<p style="color: #ffffff"> I hope everyone that listens to this little skit feels inspired to break copyright law sometime soon and make a mug of thier own. </p>
